    # Preprocess Help

    This command will preprocess all of the data you need for use with EveryVoice.

    By default every step of the preprocessor will be done by running:
    \n\n
    **everyvoice preprocess config/{TEXT_TO_SPEC_CONFIG_FILENAME_PREFIX}.yaml**
    \n\n
    If you only want to process specific things, you can run specific commands by adding them as options for example:
    \n\n
    **everyvoice preprocess config/{TEXT_TO_SPEC_CONFIG_FILENAME_PREFIX}.yaml -s energy -s pitch**
